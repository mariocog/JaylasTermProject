				<h2>What is Censorship?</h2>
				<p><a href = "https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/censorship" target="_blank">Oxford English Dictionary</a>
				defines censorship as "The suppression or prohibition of
				any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable,
				or a threat to security." <br><br>
				Censorship in television and films have existed since the early days of the first motion pictures and the
				what's been deemed as "acceptible" has changed a great deal over the years. Any organizations and governments
				can decide to censor something if they deem the content "highly objectionable." Because of that things can get censored for
				many different reasons and not always for things that people agree with. Just because an individual finds a specific
				type of content objectionable, that does not mean that other people will. It depends on the person and their morals, beliefs,
				religion, culture, and much, much more.
