				<h2>Examples of Censorship in Movies and TV Shows</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>Steven Universe</h3>
				<p>During the song "What Can I Do For You" from <i>Steven Universe</i>, the characters
				Rose Quartz and Pearl dance and fuse together. The UK deemed parts of the dance too sensual
				and censored them by replaying clips of previous scenes until the "inappropriate" scenes had passed.</p>

				<h3>Elvis Presley</h3>
				<p>In 1956 Elvis Presley appeared twice on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> and his
				<i>scandalous</i> hip movements were not censored in any way. In his 1957 appearance
				on the show CBS censors decided to crop out the lower half of his body.</p>
				<h4>Elvis's "Hound Dog" on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i></h4>

				<h3>Jane Russell</h3>
				<p>In the 1941 movie <i>The Outlaw</i>, Jane's breasts were considered
				too explicit for the Hollywood Production Code Administration who delayed the
				release of the film. 37 reshoots were requested of the actress and after being
				shelved twice, the film was eventually distributed in 1946.</p>
